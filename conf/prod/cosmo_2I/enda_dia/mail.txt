Ciao!

Attached to this email, you can find some plots for monitoring the operation of KENDA obtained 
by analyzing the EKF and YULHN files. In particular, you can find:
  - last24h.png: plot number and percentage of active, passive and rejected observations
     for each report in each assimilation cycle of the last 24 hours;
  - last30d.png: plot number and percentage of active, passive and rejected observations
      for each report in each day of the last 30 days (cumulating data of each assimilation
      cycle over each day);
  - last365d.png: same as 'last30d.png' but for the last 365 days;
  - LHN_last24h.png: plot percentage of SRI fields assimilated via LHN, the domain-average 
      and maximum SRI in each assimilation cycle of the last 24 hours;
  - LHN_last30d.png: plot percentage of SRI fields assimilated via LHN, the domain-average 
      estimated daily precipitation and maximum SRI in each day of the last 30 days 
      (cumulating data  of each assimilation cycles over each day);
  - LHN_last365d.png:  same as 'LHN_last30d.png' but for the last 365 days;
  - last30d_REP.png: number and percentage of observation types for the report REP in each 
      day of the last 30 days (cumulating data of each assimilation cycles over each day);
  - last365d_REP.png: same as 'last30d_REP.png' but for the last 365 days;
  - last30d_REP_check.png: number and percentage of reasons why (checks) the observations of 
       report REP are set passive or rejected.
  - last365d_REP_check.png: same as 'last30d_REP_check.png' but for the last 365 days.
